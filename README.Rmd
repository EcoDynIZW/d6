# `d6` Package <img src='man/figures/hexlogo_pure.png' align="right" height="151.5" /></a>

### Generic Templates for D6 Research Projects

This package works as a template for new research projects, under the idea of having everything (data, R scripts, functions and manuscript/reports) contained in the same package (a 'research compendium') to facilitate collaboration and promote reproducibility.


## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EcoDynIZW/d6")
```


## Create Project Directory

To create a new project, run the function `new_project`. This will create a directory with all the scaffolding we use for all projects in our department. For example, to start a new project in the current working directory, just use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
d6::new_project("project")
```

#### Use A Custom Root Directory

You don't need to change the working directory first you can also specify a path to a custom root folder in which the new project folder is created:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## both work:
d6::new_project("project", path = "absolute/path/to/the/root/folder")
## or:
d6::new_project("project", path = "absolute/path/to/the/root/folder/")
```

The resulting final directory of your project would be `absolute/path/to/the/root/folder/project`.

#### Use Version Control

If you want to create a GitHub repository for the project at the same time, use instead:

```{r eval=FALSE}
d6::new_project("project", github = TRUE)
```

By default, the visibility of the GitHub repository is set to "private" but you can also change that:

```{r eval=FALSE}
d6::new_project("project", github = TRUE, private_repo = FALSE)
```

Note that to create a GitHub repo you will need to have configured your system as explained [here](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/devtools/functions/use_github).

#### Setup without Geo Directories

If your project does not (or will not) contain any spatial data, you can prevent the creation of the directories `geo-raw` and `geo-proc` by setting `geo` to `FALSE`:

```{r eval=FALSE}
d6::new_project("project", geo = FALSE)
```


## Add Documentation to Your Project

After you have set up your project directory, open the file `00_start.R` in the `R` folder. Add the details of your project, fill in the readme, add a MIT license (if needed) and add package dependencies.


## Use Script Templates

The package also provides several templates for your scripts. In Rstudio, navigate to `File > New File > RMarkdown... > Templates` and choose the template you want to use. 

The following templates are available:
